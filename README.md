Product Roadmap
> üó∫ Odown public roadmap. All planned features, updates and tweaks

<br>

This roadmap contains all the tweaks, improvements and new features we plan for Odown. 
Of course, things change and we may shuffle priorities at any time. At Odown we learn A TON from talking to users, so don't hesitate to contact us with your ideas and feedback.

Check the [Kanban board in this project](https://github.com/odown-io/public-roadmap/projects/1) for an overview.

Note: not all small updates and features will be tracked here; we regularly make small updates based on private feedback or our own discoveries and we'd rather ship them than create and close tickets here.
